    client shall be responsible for any and all outstanding 
    fees owed to torrentql and agrees to pay any and all fees

    incurred each month, regardless of when client provides notice
    of termination or if a balance is left on the account.

  <Markdown>
    ## Acceptable Use Policy
  </Markdown>
  <Markdown>
    As a provider of web site hosting and other Internet-related 
    services, torrentql offers its customer (also known as “Subscribers”)
    and their customers and users the means to acquire and disseminate a 
    wealth of public, private, commercial and non-commercial information. 
    Torrentql respects that the Internet provides a forum for free and 
    open discussion and dissemination of information. However, when 
    there are competing interests at issue, torrentql reserves the 
    right to take certain preventive or corrective actions. In order 
    to protect these competing interests, torrentql has developed an 
    Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”), which supplements and explains 
    certain terms of each customer’s respective service agreement, 
    and is intended as a guide to the customer’s rights and obligations 
    when using torrentql’ services. This AUP will be revised from time 
    to time.
  </Markdown>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <Markdown>
    One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party 
    owns or controls it. This fact accounts for much of the 
    Internet’s openness and value, but it also places a high 
    premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who 
    use it, both in the information they acquire and in the 
    information they disseminate to others. When subscribers 
    obtain information through the Internet, they must keep 
    in mind that torrentql cannot monitor, verify, warrant 
    or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information 
    they acquire. For this reason, the subscriber must exercise 
    his or her best judgment in relying on information obtained 
    from the Internet, and also should be aware that some material 
    posted to the Internet may be sexually explicit or otherwise 
    offensive. Because torrentql cannot monitor or censor the 
    Internet, and will not attempt to do so, torrentql cannot 
    accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers 
    resulting from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive or illegal 
    Internet communications.
  </Markdown>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <Markdown>
    When subscribers disseminate information from the Internet, 
    they must keep in mind that torrentql does not review, edit, 
    censor or take responsibility for any information its 
    subscribers may create. When users place information on the 
    Internet, they have the same liability as other authors for 
    copyright infringement, defamation and other harmful speech. 
    Also, because the information created is carried over 
    torrentql’s network and may reach a large number of people, 
    including both subscribers and non-subscribers of torrentql, 
    subscribers’ postings to the Internet may affect other 
    subscribers and may affect torrentql’s goodwill, business, 
    reputation or operations. For these reasons, subscribers
    violate torrentql policy and the Service Agreement when they, their 
    customers, affiliates or subsidiaries engage in the following 
    prohibited activities and is grounds for immediate termination of
    services without refund:
  </Markdown>

  </Markdown>
  <Markdown>

    in case of torrentql's service being used for sending out 
    spam, will result in termination of the service. Sending 
    unsolicited bulk and/or commercial information over the 
    Internet. It is not only harmful because of its negative 
    impact on consumer attitudes toward torrentql, but also 
    because it can overload torrentql’s network and disrupt 
    service to torrentql’ subscribers. Also, maintaining an 
    open SMTP relay is prohibited. When a complaint is received, 
    torrentql will investigate and shutdown the account that is 
    SPAMing. A $250 charge for violating this policy will be 
    charged to the person initiating the SPAM. Furthermore 
    torrentql reserves the right to prosecute for this violation. 
    A $1.00 charge will be assessed PER EMAIL sent should torrentql 
    choose to pursue and prosecute.

  </Markdown>
  <Markdown>

  </Markdown>
  <br />
  <br /> 
  <Markdown>
   As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding harmful 
   activities just described rests primarily with the subscriber. 
   torrentql will not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the 
   communications of its subscribers to ensure that the comply 
   with torrentql’ policy or applicable law. However, when torrentql 
   becomes aware of harmful activities, it may take any action to 
   stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited to, removal 
   of information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening 
   software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access 
   to the Internet, or any other action deemed appropriate by torrentql.
  </Markdown>
  <br />
  <br /> 
  <Markdown>
    Torrentql is also aware that many of its subscribers are 
    themselves providers of Internet services, and that information
    reaching torrentql’ facilities from those subscribers may have 
    originated from a customer of the subscriber or from another 
    third party. torrentql does not require its subscribers who 
    offer Internet services to monitor or censor transmissions or 
    web sites created by customers of its subscribers. torrentql 
    reserves the right to directly take action against a customer 
    of its subscribers. Also, torrentql may take action against the 
    torrentql’ subscriber because of activities of a customer of the 
    subscriber, even though the action may affect other customers of 
    the subscriber. Similarly, torrentql anticipates that subscribers 
    who offer Internet services will cooperate with torrentql in any 
    corrective or preventive action that torrentql deems necessary. 
    Failure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive measures 
    is a violation of torrentql policy.
  </Markdown>
  <br />
  <br /> 
  <Markdown>
    Torrentql will not intentionally monitor private electronic 
    mail messages sent or receive by its subscribers, unless required 
    to do so by law, governmental authority or when public safety is 
    at stake. torrentql may, however, monitor its service electronically
    to determine that its facilities are operating satisfactorily. 
    Also, torrentql may disclose information, including, but not 
    limited to, information concerning a subscriber, a transmission 
    made using our network, or a web site, in order to comply with a 
    court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute,
    regulation or governmental request. torrentql assumes not obligation
    to inform the subscriber that subscriber information has been
    provided and, in some cases, may be prohibited by law from giving
    such notice. Finally, torrentql may disclose subscriber information
    or information transmitted over its network where necessary to protect
    torrentql and others from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary 
    to the proper operation of the system. However, torrentql will never 
    sell information to other services or outside companies.
  </Markdown>
  <br />
  <br /> 
  <Markdown>
    Torrentql expects that its subscribers who provide Internet 
    services to others will comply fully with all applicable laws 
    concerning the privacy of online communications. A subscriber’s 
    failure to comply with those laws will violate torrentql policy. 
    Finally, torrentql wishes to emphasize that, in signing the Service
    Agreement, subscribers indemnify torrentql for any violation of 
    the Service Agreement, law or torrentql policy resulting in loss
    to torrentql or the bringing of any claim against torrentql by 
    any third party. This means that, if torrentql is sued because 
    of a subscribers or customer of a subscriber’s activity, the 
    subscriber will be responsible for payment of any damages 
    awarded against torrentql, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.
  </Markdown>
  <br />
  <br /> 
  <Markdown>
    We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet
    users, including torrentql and its subscribers, as responsible members 
    of the Internet. Any complaints about a subscriber’s violation of 
    this AUP should be sent to mail [@] torrentql.
