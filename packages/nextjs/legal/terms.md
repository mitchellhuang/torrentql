traffic allowance. We monitor all accounts and may suspend
services in case of overusage.

### Server Abuse

Any attempt to undermine or cause harm to a server or 
customer of TorrentQL is strictly prohibited. As our 
customer you are responsible for all your accounts. 
Should you violate the Terms of Services outlined within, 
your account will be cancelled without the option of refund.

### Refusal of Service

We reserve the right to refuse, cancel or suspend service,
at our sole discretion.

All sub-networks, distributive hosting sites and dedicated 
servers of TorrentQL must adhere to the above policies, 
with the exception of system resources in respect to dedicated 
servers.

### Billing

By the Account Activation, TorrentQL shall either:

Debit the client’s credit card and give an allotted virtual credit 
(when such information has been provided by the client); or recieve 
payment via bitcoin.

TorrentQL shall be entitled to 
immediately terminate this agreement for clients failure to 
make timely payments or if invalid payment methods are provided. 
You will be provided with an invoice on
a rolling basis. All credit cards are billed automatically on
a rolling basis based on number of gigabits uploaded by client.
It is the client’s responsibility to ensure 
that they have sufficient credit to cover each transaction. 
In the event that there is insufficient credit, we will send
an e-mail notification, at which point we will need to be 
provided with another credit card account number within 24 hours.
If we do not receive a response within 24 hours, the account,
and all accounts under that account plan, will be suspended,
and no refunds shall be given.

Filing a dispute/chargeback for any paid sum will void 
any rights to hold a service with TorrentQL - All active 
services will be terminated without the option of getting a refund.

### Service Fees

Certain services carry a setup fee charged by TorrentQL to 
client, which must be paid by client in order to have use 
of said services. If client terminates this agreement, 
client shall be responsible for any and all outstanding 
fees owed to TorrentQL and agrees to pay any and all fees 
incurred by client. Because the services are provided on a 
monthly basis, the client will be responsible for service fees
incurred each month, regardless of when client provides notice
of termination or if a balance is left on the account. 
Thus, for example, if the client provides notice of termination
on the 15th day of a particular month, the client will be responsible
for service fees for the entire month, and such fees will not be
pro-rated or refunded.

### Refund policy

No refunds are issued for setup charges, add-on charges, 
domain-registrations, add-on purchases, SSL certificates

including incidental or consequential damages, resulting

### Acceptable Use Policy

As a provider of web site hosting and other Internet-related 
services, TorrentQL offers its customer (also known as “Subscribers”)
and their customers and users the means to acquire and disseminate a 
wealth of public, private, commercial and non-commercial information. 
TorrentQL respects that the Internet provides a forum for free and 
open discussion and dissemination of information. However, when 
there are competing interests at issue, TorrentQL reserves the 
right to take certain preventive or corrective actions. In order 
to protect these competing interests, TorrentQL has developed an 
Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”), which supplements and explains 
certain terms of each customer’s respective service agreement, 
and is intended as a guide to the customer’s rights and obligations 
when using TorrentQL’ services. This AUP will be revised from time 
to time.

One important aspect of the Internet is that no one party 
owns or controls it. This fact accounts for much of the 
Internet’s openness and value, but it also places a high 
premium on the judgment and responsibility of those who 
use it, both in the information they acquire and in the 
information they disseminate to others. When subscribers 
obtain information through the Internet, they must keep 
in mind that TorrentQL cannot monitor, verify, warrant 
or vouch for the accuracy and quality of the information 
they acquire. For this reason, the subscriber must exercise 
his or her best judgment in relying on information obtained 
from the Internet, and also should be aware that some material 
posted to the Internet may be sexually explicit or otherwise 
offensive. Because TorrentQL cannot monitor or censor the 
Internet, and will not attempt to do so, TorrentQL cannot 
accept any responsibility for injury to its subscribers 
resulting from inaccurate, unsuitable, offensive or illegal 
Internet communications.

When subscribers disseminate information from the Internet, 
they must keep in mind that TorrentQL does not review, edit, 
censor or take responsibility for any information its 
subscribers may create. When users place information on the 
Internet, they have the same liability as other authors for 
copyright infringement, defamation and other harmful speech. 
Also, because the information created is carried over 
TorrentQL’s network and may reach a large number of people, 
including both subscribers and non-subscribers of TorrentQL, 
subscribers’ postings to the Internet may affect other 
subscribers and may affect TorrentQL’s goodwill, business, 
reputation or operations. For these reasons, subscribers
violate TorrentQL policy and the Service Agreement when they, their 
customers, affiliates or subsidiaries engage in the following 
prohibited activities and is grounds for immediate termination of
services without refund:

#### Spamming

TorrentQL has a zero tolerancy policy against spamming, 
in case of TorrentQL's service being used for sending out 
spam, will result in termination of the service. Sending 
unsolicited bulk and/or commercial information over the 
Internet. It is not only harmful because of its negative 
impact on consumer attitudes toward TorrentQL, but also 
because it can overload TorrentQL’s network and disrupt 
service to TorrentQL’ subscribers. Also, maintaining an 
open SMTP relay is prohibited. When a complaint is received, 
TorrentQL will investigate and shutdown the account that is 
SPAMing. A $250 charge for violating this policy will be 
charged to the person initiating the SPAM. Furthermore 
TorrentQL reserves the right to prosecute for this violation. 
A $1.00 charge will be assessed PER EMAIL sent should TorrentQL 
choose to pursue and prosecute.

#### Obscene Speech or Materials

Using TorrentQL’s network to advertise, transmit, store, post, 
display, or otherwise make available child pornography or obscene 
speech or material is prohibited. TorrentQL is required by law to 
notify law enforcement agencies when it becomes aware of the 
presence of child pornography on or being transmitted through 
its network.

#### Defamatory or Abusive Language

Using TorrentQL’s network as a means to transmit or post negative,
defamatory, harassing, abusive or threatening language.

#### Forging of Headers:

in part, to mask the originator of the message.

negatively hurt the reputation of TorrentQL

#### Illegal or Unauthorized Access to Other Computers or Networks

Accessing, illegally or without authorization, computers, 
accounts or networks belonging to another party, or attempting 
to penetrate security measures of another individual’s system 
(often known as “hacking”). Also, any activity that may be used 
as a precursor to an attempted system penetration 
(i.e., port scan, stealth scan or other 
information-gathering activity).

#### Distribution of Internet Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses or Other Destructive Activities: 

Distributing information regarding the creation of and sending 
Internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses, pinging, flooding, mail 
bombing or denial of service attacks. Also, activities that 
disrupt the use of or interfere with the ability of others to 
effectively use the network or any connected network, system, 
service or equipment.

#### Facilitation a Violation of this AUP

attacks and piracy of software.

#### Other Illegal Activities

including, but not limited to, advertising, transmitting or 
otherwise making available ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes, 
fraudulently charging credit cards and pirating software.

#### Other Activities

determines to be harmful to its subscribers, operations, reputation, 
goodwill or customer relations.

### Public Trackers

Public Trackers are allowed on our seedboxes.

As we have pointed out, the responsibility for avoiding harmful 
activities just described rests primarily with the subscriber. 
TorrentQL will not, as an ordinary practice, monitor the 
communications of its subscribers to ensure that the comply 
with TorrentQL’ policy or applicable law. However, when TorrentQL 
becomes aware of harmful activities, it may take any action to 
stop the harmful activity, including, but not limited to, removal 
of information, shutting down a web site, implementing screening 
software designed to block offending transmissions, denying access 
to the Internet, or any other action deemed appropriate by TorrentQL.

TorrentQL is also aware that many of its subscribers are 
themselves providers of Internet services, and that information
reaching TorrentQL’ facilities from those subscribers may have 
originated from a customer of the subscriber or from another 
third party. TorrentQL does not require its subscribers who 
offer Internet services to monitor or censor transmissions or 
web sites created by customers of its subscribers. TorrentQL 
reserves the right to directly take action against a customer 
of its subscribers. Also, TorrentQL may take action against the 
TorrentQL’ subscriber because of activities of a customer of the 
subscriber, even though the action may affect other customers of 
the subscriber. Similarly, TorrentQL anticipates that subscribers 
who offer Internet services will cooperate with TorrentQL in any 
corrective or preventive action that TorrentQL deems necessary. 
Failure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive measures 
is a violation of TorrentQL policy.

TorrentQL will not intentionally monitor private electronic 
mail messages sent or receive by its subscribers, unless required 
to do so by law, governmental authority or when public safety is 
at stake. TorrentQL may, however, monitor its service electronically
to determine that its facilities are operating satisfactorily. 
Also, TorrentQL may disclose information, including, but not 
limited to, information concerning a subscriber, a transmission 
made using our network, or a web site, in order to comply with a 
court order, subpoena, summons, discovery request, warrant, statute,
regulation or governmental request. TorrentQL assumes not obligation
to inform the subscriber that subscriber information has been
provided and, in some cases, may be prohibited by law from giving
such notice. Finally, TorrentQL may disclose subscriber information
or information transmitted over its network where necessary to protect
TorrentQL and others from harm, or where such disclosure is necessary 
to the proper operation of the system. However, TorrentQL will never 
sell information to other services or outside companies.

TorrentQL expects that its subscribers who provide Internet 
services to others will comply fully with all applicable laws 
concerning the privacy of online communications. A subscriber’s 
failure to comply with those laws will violate TorrentQL policy. 
Finally, TorrentQL wishes to emphasize that, in signing the Service
Agreement, subscribers indemnify TorrentQL for any violation of 
the Service Agreement, law or TorrentQL policy resulting in loss
to TorrentQL or the bringing of any claim against TorrentQL by 
any third party. This means that, if TorrentQL is sued because 
of a subscribers or customer of a subscriber’s activity, the 
subscriber will be responsible for payment of any damages 
awarded against TorrentQL, plus costs and reasonable attorney’s fees.

We hope this AUP is helpful in clarifying the obligations of Internet
users, including TorrentQL and its subscribers, as responsible members 
of the Internet. Any complaints about a subscriber’s violation of 
this AUP should be sent to support@torrentql.com.
